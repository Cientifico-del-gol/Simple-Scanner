This is a simple Python program designed to scan your computer for .exe files, which are one of the most common sources of malware, and compare the results to a database of known malware extracted from "https://bazaar.abuse.ch/" on 03/02/2024. The script works in two main stages. First, it reads a CSV file (full.csv), extracts unique executable names, and saves them in newlistmalware.txt to create the malware database. In the second stage, it scans a specified directory (default is C:/) for executable files, compares them against the malware database, identifies potential threats, and saves these threats in Possiblethreats.txt. While the script aims to detect dangerous .exe files, it may flag legitimate files that behave similarly to malware, as malware is often disguised as legitimate software. Therefore, it is recommended to further investigate flagged files to determine if they are indeed safe and legitimate.The script is accompanied by a .exe file for running the detection algorithm without installing Python.

To investigate if they are actually safe and legitimate:

1. Got to C:\ in your file explorer
2. Type in the searchbar the name of the .exe file (It may take a bit)
3. When found, check it's digital signature by right clicking them and searching for it in "properties". 

If you see that there is no signature or that it has a strange name you should probably delete the file, BUT DO BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS SINCE YOU CAN ACCIDENTALY DELETE ESSENTIAL PROGRAMS FORM YOUR DEVICE. SO, BEFORE DELETING ANYTHING, YOU SHOULD GOOGLE THE NAMES OF THE FILES AND SIGNATURES TO INVESTIGATE IF THEY ARE FROM MALICIOUS ACTORS OR NOT.

Also, due to the everchanging nature of digital threats, the database on that internet site is constantly being updated (aprox. once every hour), so the data might be a bit out of date. However, there is a way to update the database and get an updated scan:

1. Go to https://bazaar.abuse.ch/export/
2. Export most recent .csv file
3. Put .csv file in the "materials" folder
4. Run the file "fullread.py" in that same folder to parse the database and extract the .exe files in the document, using the terminal form your device (assuming you have also downloaded Python in your computer)
5. It should produce or update a txt document with a list of the .exe threats identified in the .csv file inside that same folder
6. Copy or move the txt file to the folder "ScannerDownLoad"
7. Run the file "scannermalware" inside that folder using the terminal form your device
8. It should produce or update (if you have already run the scanner) a txt document called "Possiblethreats.txt" with the list of suspicious .exe programs

IMPORTANT: This is not an "antivirus" and it doesn't replace their use or the use of a VPN or not taking the necessary precautions to secure your device!
